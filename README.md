# Module_3_Challenge

This repository includes two files, PyBank and PyPoll. Each file contains a resource foulder, with their corresponding CSV files; a folder containing the python script for the analysis on the corresponding dataset, and a text file with a summary of the analysis.

Notes on Assignment:

In the PyBank portion of the assignment, I calculated the mean by importing the "Statistics" module and calling the mean function. I´m aware that it can also be done manually, but I thought importing the module and simply calling the method was a more ergonomic and efficient way to achieve this.

Within the PyPoll assignment, I obtained the name of each individual candidate by using a loop with a double conditional statement. While this could´ve been done by simply setting up a conditional statement having the list value being equal to the names of each one of the three candidate, I believe that by using the loop I wrote in the python file we can optimize the script so that it can pull the name of each candidate no matter how large the amount of candidates is.
